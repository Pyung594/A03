# Git is a version control system that is designed to allow developers to roll back to previous versions of their projects efficiently. Github is essentially Git but allows for saving on the internet. Github allows users to make their code open source for collaborators to work on/edit the code. WebStorm is an integrated development environment for coding in JavaScript and its related technologies.
